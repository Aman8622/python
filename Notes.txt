Why Python?
-> Shell vs Python
--> Linux is preferred because of its security and simplicity.
--> MacOS and Windows are more rich user interface specific with rich GUI.
--> Linux is a popular choice for hosting servers.
--> Shell is used to interact with Linux systems.
--> Shell commands vs scripting -> create a file test.sh and write a bunch of shell commands in it. then run it using ./test.sh. All the shell commands are executed serially. In other words, it is a way of running multiple shell commands at once in order to primarily interact with linux systems and manage them.
--> Shell is restricted to linux. Python on the other hand can be used to write scripts for multiple OS.
--> Ansible is based on python.
--> Simple tasks -> Shell Scripting
--> Complex tasks -> Python Scripting
--> Day-to-Day tasks, system administration, file management, networking, mounting,attaching and removing volumes -> Shell Scripting.
--> API interactions, Launching instances, Data manipulation, Computational tasks, Automation -> Python Scripting.
--> Ansible can be used to perform simple tasks. But, inorder to perform complex tasks, python is generally preferred.
--> Python has rich modules that are designed to easily handle complex tasks.


Datatypes in Python:
1. Numeric: int, float, custom.
2. Sequence: string, list, tuple.
3. Mapping: dict.
4. Set: set, frozenset.
5. Boolean: true or false.
6. Binary: byte, bytearray.
7. None: none.
8. Custom: declare custom datatypes using classes and objects.
